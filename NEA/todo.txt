Server:
 - new connections: either game id (join existing) or no game id (create a new game)
 - setup game: send all important data to each client in game
 - making moves: move valid or not, update data to each client accordingly
 - class to encompass database access
 - spectators list for a game to view it without making moves

Client:
 - login/sign up, account management
 - new game/join game page
 - leaderboard page
 - matchmaking (looking for game)

AI:
 - centralised service to handle all computer players at once and emulate them as other signalR clients
 - replicate python AI 
 - find data to train AI on
 - begin training of AI and how to store model data for a point in time in the training process

Data Analytics:
 - every time a move is made, hash the game state into a single value and add it to / update the database
 - record win/loss for each game and every move made for a certain game

Data Storage:
 - SQL relational database
 - tables: Accounts, Active Games, Archived Games, leaderboard, chat log
 - hashing algorithm for gamestate to return a single value (possibly one long binary string)
 - look for an online tablebase store / api
 - populate my own tablebase from an existing one
 - relationships: each game includes the players that played in it, every message in the chat log includes a gameid
 - looking into stored procedures to run certain aspects of logic in the SQL server itself

REWRITE CHESSENGINE TO WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY:
 - make use of bit boards as a more efficient way to transport boards and positions
 - create an OOP design which allows for modularity later on such as creating different variants more easily

Hashing:
 - use zobrist hashing to produce unique hash results for every possible position on a chess board
 - put results into a transposition table, probably as part of the database
 - use this hash value to keep track of evaluations for a given position so that they can be used again without recalculation
