# So Far:

I have been able to create a functioning system for a simpler game (connect-4) where multiple clients (in my case these are just separate tabs)
are able to connect to the same "hub" which then allows them to play a game against eachother.
This functions as a good proof of concept for my idea and that I should be able to replicate this with chess once I have finished my interface to
follow UCI rules for chess interfaces.
