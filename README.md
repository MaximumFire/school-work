# school-work

This is a general collection of all of the work I complete at/for my school course (UK A-Level Computer Science).

The "NEA" folder contains all of my messy work for my non-exam assessment.

The "NEA-Final" folder will contain the final project once I collapse all the individual parts of it down into one solution.
